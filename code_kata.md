# Code Kata

### 1.1
Create a program that acts as a calculator to help you do your math homework. Use an equation like: `y = ax**2 + bx + c` (Grade 12) or `y = mx + b` (Grade 10).
1. Hard code the whole print statement with literal numbers.
2. Factor out each variable, one at a time, running and testing along the way.
3. Once all variables have been factored out, you may add user input for the variables

## End results
End results are not the point of a code kata. It is the *process* you go through to arrive at the end that matters. Memorize that *process*, not the end result. 

### 1.1
#### Grade 10
```python
x = 4
m = 3
b = 5
y = m*x + b
print(y)
```
#### Grade 11
```python
x = 3
a = 5
b = 7
c = 9
y = a*x**2 + b*x + c
print(y)
```
