16 Fridays + 2 Week consolidation

### 1. Introduction
- Ideas
- Past projects
    - [Semester 1 CPTs](https://gist.github.com/MrGallo/d4102e78834171fcc92a822d8a65110b)
    - [arcade.academy](http://arcade.academy/sample_games.html#games-from-simpson-college-spring-2017-cmsc-150-course)

### 2. What do you want to build?
We will *not* be working as groups yet. Each student is responsible for their own ideas. 
It is OK, however, if you already have an idea of who you would like to pair up with. 
When it is time, I may recommend you pair up with another student who is interested in working on a similar project.
- You will come up with two project ideas. For each, come up with:
  1. a quick storyboard (1 frame)
      - What will this program look like?
  2. what objects (things) and functionality (behaviours) will the game/program have?

### 3. Work Period

### 4. Pick Something
- Storyboard, objects, and functionality in depth.
- General aesthetic (look and feel)
- Method(s) of user input
- Different screens (menu, instructions, game, etc.)

### 5. Game State Representation Workshop
(How to store things)

**Example with Monopoly**

Look up the rules for the board-game [monopoly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Monopoly/Official_Rules).
- How can you represent the things of the board game with variables and data-types?
- Create a representation of the game in code.

**Snakes and Ladders**

You will play this game on a whiteboard, with **only** numbers and data that can be stored in a computer. There will be *no* visual representation of the game.

Check out the 
[rules for snakes and ladders](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8f5e6a_8d3deecdb7f649a980a86289c9f40796.png/v1/fill/w_935,h_612,al_c/8f5e6a_8d3deecdb7f649a980a86289c9f40796.png)
and figure out what sorts of data a program would need to hold.

Also, with pseudocode, write down the steps everyone goes through until the end.

Check out the 
[Game Board](https://media.buzzle.com/media/images-en/gallery/sports/400-chutes-and-ladders.jpg).
 With code, how would we ensure there is a consequence when a player 'lands' on a special space?
 Write down a few examples, to do them all would be a bit tedious.
 
At this point, you can play a mock game with your friend(s) using **only** numbers and manipulating data on a whiteboard. No visuals allowed! You may look at the image of the game board for the special spaces.

**Assignment:** Save pictures of your *game-state representation* and *pseudocode* and attach them to the assignment. 

### 6. Work Period - Game State Representation
How can you represent your CPT idea as code?
- Create those variables in a program

### 7. Game Logic
- What functionality will require if/loops/lists/functions?
- Pseudo-code
- Do you need to change the way things are represented in the code?

### 8. Work Period - Game Logic

### 9. Functionality Prototype 1
Choose a simple behaviour or feature of your game and code it. E.g., button click/hover.

### 10. Functionality Prototype 2

### 11. Functionality Prototype 3

### 12. Source Assets
One period to find images/sprites for your game. Use [Keeney.nl](www.keeney.nl).
Get link to sprite pack.
