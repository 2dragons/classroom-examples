# Evaluation Prep
Create two files: `evaluation_prep.py` and `test_evaluation_prep.py`. Your functions will go in `evaluation_prep.py` 
and your tests will go in `test_evaluation_prep.py`.

For each function below:
- create the function
- annotate the function
- create a docstring
- and create tests for the function.

1. Create a function that takes two integers `a` and `b`. The function will return the sum of the two integers.
2. Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers.
3. Create a function that takes a list of words. Then create and return a dictionary where the key is 
the word and the value is how many times the word appears in the list.
